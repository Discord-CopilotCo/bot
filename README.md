# Microsoft Copilot is now on Discord! ü§ñ
## How to use:
1. Make an application
2. Get your discord bot token.
3. Rename the hidden file ".env.example" to ".env"
4. Open it with an editor, place your token right after `DISCORD_TOKEN=`¬π,  and your userID right after `BOT_OWNER=`¬≤¬≥ then save the file.
5. Install the cookie editor extension for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cookie-editor/hlkenndednhfkekhgcdicdfddnkalmdm) or [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookie-editor/)
6. Go to https://copilot.microsoft.com/
7. Open the extension
8. Click "Export" on the bottom right, then "Export as JSON" (This saves your cookies to clipboard)
9. Paste your cookies into the file `bing_cookies.json`, remove existing content.
   - NOTE: The **cookies file name MUST follow the regex pattern `bing_cookies.json`**, so that they could be recognized by internal cookie processing mechanisms
10. Install dependencies: `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
11. Run the bot: `python3 main.py`

To see statistics, use "cp!stats"
